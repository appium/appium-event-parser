appium-event-parser
===========

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/appium/appium-event-parser.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a simple CLI script to parse Appium event timings. What are event timings? When you pass the capability `eventTimings` with the value `true` to an Appium session, then when calling the get session capabilities command in your client (`GET /session/:id`) you will have an `events` key in the response object. This key contains information about Appium-internal events and when they occurred. This information is useful for profiling Appium or debugging Appium, and is not generally useful for users.

Any custom data added to the event timing JSON (for instance, to identify a build) can be marked with a property `iterate` set to `false`.

## Installation

```
npm install -g appium-event-parser
```

## Requirements

* NodeJS v7+

## Usage

First of all you need to have the output from `GET /session/:id` stored in a `.json` file somewhere. The best time to call `GET /session/:id` is right before calling `driver.quit()` so that you know you've received all the events you might care about.

### Timeline

You can build a timeline of the events from this session using `-t`:

```
appium-event-parser -t -i /path/too/response.json
```

Which will show something like:

### Comparison statistics

If you have a directory with lots of session capabilities `.json` files, you can get stastical information about certain events we care about in the XCUITest driver:

```
appium-event-parser -s -i /path/to/dir/with/jsons
```

And you'll get something like:

```
{ avgs:
   { simStartLength: 41.5121,
     wdaStartLength: 17.941200000000002,
     wdaSessionStartLength: 2.0113000000000003,
     numWdaStartAttempts: 1,
     numWdaSessionAttempts: 1 },
  stdevs:
   { simStartLength: 2.4527162269614475,
     wdaStartLength: 2.4414009420822302,
     wdaSessionStartLength: 0.13611102086164817,
     numWdaStartAttempts: 0,
     numWdaSessionAttempts: 0 } }
```

That's about it!
